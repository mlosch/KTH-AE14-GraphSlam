- Data association
	- variable measurement noise dependent on distance
	- incorporate noise in distance to hessian plane (howto?)
	- accumulate subset of measurements until update? (e.g. 5 measurements per update)
- Update step
	- see graph slam tutorial
- Graph optimization (howto?)
	- matching for loop closure necessary?
		- match planes?
		- match raw measurements?
